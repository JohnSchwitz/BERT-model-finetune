# BERT-model
BERT End to End (PreProcessing, Fine-tuning, and Predicting) with Cloud TPU. This is adaptable for Fine-tuning on all SQUAD tasks. This does not encompass Named Entity Recognition (NER). PreProcessing is integrated into the PipeLine to permit Inference from raw data. This is Question / Answer (QNLI) used to discover Terms and Conditions in Limited Partnership Agreements (LPAs). However; Additional PreProcessing is Required since Terms and Conditions are scattered throughout the LPA.

Minimize costs by using Colab or Colab Pro for experimentation.
